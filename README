# Visual Inference Tools

Traditional methods of teaching statistical inference rely on concepts such as probability distributions that are unfamiliar to students. This may overwhelm a student's cognitive load and hinder understanding. These tools simplify the intuition behind inference to a visual level. They can be used to develop a student's intuitions about inference before teaching mathematical and probabilistic concepts.
