Description: Traditional methods of teaching statistical 
	inference rely on concepts that are unfamiliar to students, 
	such as probability distributions. This may overwhelm a 
	student's cognitive load and hinder understanding. These 
	tools simplify the intuition behind inference to a visual 
	level. They can be used to develop a student's intuitions 
	about inference before teaching mathematical and 
	probabilistic concepts.
